		<OL><P><LI><B><I>Line Wire:</I></B><BR />This is made up of 3.05mm diameter high carbon steel wire, with a tensile strength of 170 to 180 kg/mm². The wire is drawn and dressed in such a manner that the coils formed will fall naturally into the specified diameter without forming a figure eight. Line wire is heavy hot dipped galvanized with minimum inc coating of 185 gm/mm2.
		<P><LI><B><I>Barbed Wire:</I></B><BR />This is 2.00mm diameter bright mild steel wire with a tensile strength of 38 to 55kg/mm² conforming to BS 1052. The wire is hot dipped galvanized with a minimum zinc coating of 20 to 50 gm/mm². The barbs are formed with four points. Spacing between the centers of the barbs of every 70mm along the length of the wire. The barbs are firmly secured by indentations made on the wire, so that the barbs do not rotate or slide along the wire. The four points of the barbs are formed at the right angles to one another and project outwards approximately 12mm from the center of the wire.

Barbed tape barrier systems are more vicious and difficult to tamper with, providing superior perimeter security. Some of the users are military installations, nuclear energy sites, maximum-security prisons, various petroleum installations, tank farms and other important industrial facilities.</span>

				<TD><span style="color:#008000">To give the maximum tensile strength at the time of the breach hard drawn steel cord is used (ES1). For camouflage purposes, a coaltar coating can be applied over the entire surface (ES-1), and to attain the high degree of rust resistance, the core wire is made of galvanized steel (ES-2). Any of the above three options are available to meet your specific requirements.</span></TD>

				<TD><span style="color:#008000">The specification of the "ivory" tape is similar to those of ES types. The blades are sharper and have a greater pricking capacity. The life of this tape is more than three times longer than those of ES types. Therefore, "ivory" tape is a more effective choice in terrain which has heavy rain or in coastal areas. The diameter will be similar to ES type.</span></TD>
